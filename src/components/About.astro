  <p class="section-label">[ WHO I AM ]</p>
  <p>
    Born in Venezuela, based in Argentina. I don't care about roles and methods. 
    I prefer doing stuff. Deep in the trenches of DeFi and stablecoins since 2018. 
    Currently building great experiences at W3G, running marketing operations 
    for Sky (fka MakerDAO), and advising stablecoin projects. I also invest in 
    early-stage founders and never stop being a student of the game.
