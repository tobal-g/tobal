This is my personal website's project.

This is the structure I want this website to have:

About me: Born in Venezuela, based in Argentina. I don't care about roles. I prefer doing stuff. I've been deep in the trenches of DeFi and stablecoins since 2018. Currently building great experiences at W3G, running marketing operations for Sky (fka MakerDAO), and advising stablecoin projects. I also invest in early-stage founders and never stop being a student of the game.

Some stuff I have been involved in:

Buenbit (2018) (hyperlink: https://buenbit.com/): Early employee. Built the first community and social media strategy. Helped grow from a few thousand to 500k+ users as it became one of the largest stablecoin exchanges in Argentina (acquired by Nexo in 2026).

MakerDAO (2021) (hyperlink: https://sky.money/): Joined the Growth Core Unit managing the main MakerDAO Twitter account. Added 100k+ followers and expanded into running operations (running operations hyperlink to https://forum.sky.money/t/maker-brand-team-monthly-update-may-2022/15980) for partnerships, campaigns, events, websites, GTM, and the rebrand to Sky (rebrand to Sky hyperlink to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-27/defi-platform-makerdao-rebrands-itself-as-sky-to-bolster-usage). Sky currently generates $300M+ in revenue with $9b+ in stablecoin supply ($300M+ in revenue with $9b in stablecoin supply hyperlink to https://info.sky.money/).

W3G (2023) (hyperlink to https://w3g.io/): Started Web3 Growth with former MakerDAO Growth members. Beyond Sky, we've handled marketing for Spark, Velora, Etherealize, and Reserve. W3G is now the primary marketing operator of Sky. Currently, W3G is focused on delivering awesome experiences (awesome experiences hyperlink to https://w3g.io/projects).

I like learning new stuff, so I occasionally code, read, and write. (code hyperlink to: https://github.com/tobal-g)

MORE ABOUT THE WEBSITE LOOK AND FEEL:

I love the style of the website available at the project /Users/tobal/siglo22-brand, which is CLI style with modern touches. I'd like a neutral color as background with some accent. The accent should be different from yellow though, I'm open to explore blue or green.

I want the website to be deployable to Vercel, and to be super ultra fast, so you better find a skill using you skill finder that gets you the fastest seamless website experience.

The website should be ultra minimalism, but should have attention to detail with minimal touches in interactions (links, buttons if necessary), and I was thinking of putting some algorithmic visual that can be interactive with the cursor movement. What do you think?

Design the plan to build my website.
